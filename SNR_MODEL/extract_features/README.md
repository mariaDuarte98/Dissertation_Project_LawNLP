This model uses the portuguese-bert-large. Can be downloaded from the following link: https://github.com/neuralmind-ai/portuguese-bert

Need to download bert-large-portuguese-cased for tenserflow and the vocab.txt file, and add it to the same folder as the portuguese-bert model.
After downloading everything, need to run the .sh file that will read the sentences in train.json and create the embeddings.
