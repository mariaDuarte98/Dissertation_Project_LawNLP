This folder contains the code for the SNR(Semantic Norm Recognition) system.
It also contains the scripts responsible for training, optimizing and making predictions.
This system is based on the Named Entity Recognition as Dependency Parsing model created by Yu, Bohnet and Poesio (from https://github.com/juntaoy/biaffine-ner), with some modifications to fulfil the objective of my master's thesis: Natural Langueguage Processing applied to the Portuguese Consusmer law.

The SNR system is an information extraction system to extract norms, named entities and semantic relationships from portuguese consumer laws. This system uses 3 models, each one responsible for predicting a group of labels. Each one corresponds to a nested NER model, based on the model of Yu, Bohnet and Poesio (from https://github.com/juntaoy/biaffine-ner). The base code came from them, where some fodifications were done, since we only use BERT as embeddings and they used 3 different types. This system's models and their structure are configured in the .conf files, this process is still not comletly automated since the major focus was on training and optimizing the models and analysing the results. A future link to the dissertation will be added here once it becames public.
